# Query

I want to enable communication in between two pods in different namespaces.

# Prerequisites

To enable a pod to communicate using DNS within a Kubernetes cluster, you need to ensure the following:

1. **Correct Service Discovery Configuration**: Kubernetes services are discoverable via DNS. When you create a service, Kubernetes automatically creates a DNS entry for it.

2. **DNS Resolution Tools**: The pod image should include tools for DNS name resolution, such as `nslookup`, `dig`, or more commonly, the system's `gethostbyname` function via libraries like `glibc`. we can use busybox image.

3. **Service Configuration**: Ensure the service is properly configured to route traffic to the appropriate pod.
